## About

Eloquent JavaScript is a fantastic book about JavaScript that covers fundamental programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and data structures, as well as more complex topics like OOP and regular expressions. I read the Second Edition of Eloquent JavaScript when I first started programming in JavaScript, and thought then that it was an absolutely incredible introduction to the language. 

I continually reference the Third Edition of Eloquent JavaScript for a refresher on concepts. The Third Edition also covers several ES6 concepts, including class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope!
